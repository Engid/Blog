# why? 

I'm a really currious person. I feel like learning about new tech is like solving a big mystery, where uncovering one more secret about
the nature of computation and informatics reveals a deeper truth about who we are and how the universe evolves. But it doesn't always have
to be that deep.

Right now I'm a little obsessed with Rust. The passion has waxed and waned over the years as these things do, but one thing has remained true:
I feel like Rust just might be the most important step towards a better future for programming and software development. 

What does it offer? Well, its *fast*. It compiles right down to machine code, so it starts up fast too. The compiler can optimize a lot, because 
it demands that the programmer restrict the types of programs that can be written. That restriction helps to make it *safe*, too. But the thing I like most about it is that its a *gateway* for better understanding how our modern machines work. 

I want to master this language. I've been struggling with it for years, but I've only ever written a few dozen lines. I need a *project*, but most projects in Rust are very low level. I have a background as an application developer, who is more concerned with business logic than with worring about the machine. The only *machine* that I've worried about is a virtual machine. A language runtime. And I haven't even really worried about it at all. 

What I'm hoping for is a way to start mastering this language because I feel like its going to offer two really important things to developers and companies: high-performance, and low costs. 

How about I try to help you along this journey? I'm thinking about growing this document into a tutorial: _Rust for a C# programmer_. Why C#? Well.. that's what I use everyday, so its a lens for me to see through. Also, you might be a C# dev too. We can both share the learning journey together then. One more important thing is that I hope Rust can become as ergonomic and "developer-friendly" as C# has become, so seeing how C# is easier to use might help me contribute back to improving Rust. C# is a wonderful language, but I feel like it's tied to a heavy duty virtual machine that either requires a lot of memory or time to run fast (the time comes from the JIT). That being said, _there is nothing wrong with using C#_, but I feel like Rust solves some performance problems, and gives us a fresh start when it comes to safety.

Why am I drafting this out in public? Well.. the thought of embarassing myself might be a good motivator.. I'm not really sure why I'm doing it this way, but it might end up becoming something useful. Or I'll forget about it after a few weeks. Either way, I tried.

## Stay tuned!
